# Week0_RISC_V-SoC-Tapeout
 The RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program teaches how to design a chip from scratch. We start with RTL coding, then do logic synthesis, physical design, and verification, and finally prepare the chip for fabrication using open-source tools, contributing to India’s semiconductor growth.
RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)

Program Overview:
I am participating in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program organized by VSD (VLSI System Design). The program focuses on designing a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) using open-source tools, starting from RTL design and progressing all the way to a tapeout-ready GDSII.

My Journey:

Week 0: Set up the environment and installed required open-source EDA tools (Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, etc.).

Upcoming weeks will cover RTL design, synthesis, physical design, and final tapeout preparation.


Key Takeaways:

Hands-on experience with the full SoC design flow.

Exposure to open-source semiconductor design tools.

Contribution to India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, alongside 3500+ participants.

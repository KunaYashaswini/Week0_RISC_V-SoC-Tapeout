# Week0_RISC_V-SoC-Tapeout
 The RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program teaches how to design a chip from scratch. We start with RTL coding, then do logic synthesis, physical design, and verification, and finally prepare the chip for fabrication using open-source tools, contributing to Indiaâ€™s semiconductor growth.
